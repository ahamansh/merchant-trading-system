Assumptions are as followed:

Input related Assumptions:
	1. Parsing the input is through reg expression
	2. Inputs are case sensitive and space sensitive
		Gold is not gold
		glob is not Glob
	3. For deciding the market rates e.g. one is I, "one" should be in small letters and I sholuld be in Roman letters
	4. Credits should start with Capital letter. Credits should not be in decimal or negetive value (For the current system)
	5. Question should end in " ?" with a space followed by ?
	6. "how much is" question is used for only Market rate to number conversion should not be used for credits info
		e.g. hundred one five Bhindi is 987 Credits amd one is I
			Que: how much is one five Bhindi ?   - XXX--- Will not be considered, as Bhindi is a considered as comodity not market rates ---XXX-
			Que: how much is one five hundred ? ---> Valid question, if Validation passes :P
	7. how many Credits is Silver ? (Needs to have a market rate before Comodity)  ---->  "NOT" SAME AS    ----> how many Credits is one Silver ?
